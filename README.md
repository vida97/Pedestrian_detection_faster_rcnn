The primary goal of the project is to develop a pedestrian detection system using the Faster R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) algorithm.
Manually labeled the detected edges to create a labeled dataset. The labeling process involved marking regions of interest (ROIs) corresponding to pedestrians in the images.
Implemented the Faster R-CNN model for pedestrian detection. The input layer consisted of embedded json labelled data, which was then passed to several keras dense layers and consecutive activation functions, finally through the output layer. Acheived 94% accuracy on the test set.
